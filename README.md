# Yolo-Annotation-Tool-New

This is new yolo annotation tool which is added new features. I have posted three blogs for how to train yolov2 and v3 using our custom images.


Do steps:
```
run main.py
run process.py
```

NOTE: If you use this annotation tool, please create classes.txt file and write all classes what you train the objects. Because i read the all classes from classes.txt.

The dataset is ready for yolo training.
